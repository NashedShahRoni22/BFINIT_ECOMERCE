# API Fix

---

- [ ] FAQ Update Giving 404
- [ ] GET singleClientBankPaymentOption - remove clientId requirement, and should create one GET for admin.
- [ ] Enforce store-specific user accounts Users registered on Store A should not be able to authenticate or place orders on Store B using the same credentials (potential security/isolation issue if auth tokens are reusable across stores)
