# API Fix

---

- [ ] Update Store Main data Copy
- [ ] About CRUD should be as exact as Terms & Others Help realted content
- [ ] Enforce store-specific user accounts Users registered on Store A should not be able to authenticate or place orders on Store B using the same credentials (potential security/isolation issue if auth tokens are reusable across stores)
